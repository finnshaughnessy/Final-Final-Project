Introduction to the Job Market Scraper**
- Purpose: This section explains the scraper's aim to automate job listing collection and analysis, aiding job seekers by providing market trends and demanded skills.
- Benefits:Highlights how the tool simplifies job search efforts and provides actionable insights for career development.

Functionality Overview:
- **scrape_jobs(criteria):** Describes how users can scrape job listings by specifying search criteria such as job title and location. Criteria should be passed as a dictionary.
- **analyze_skills(job_listings):** Explains the analysis of job listings to count skill frequencies, requiring a list of job listings as input.
- **generate_summary_report(analysis_results):** Outlines the process for creating a summary report from the analysis results, detailing market trends and insights.

Input Data Structure:
- The input format for `scrape_jobs` is detailed, specifying required dictionary keys for search parameters.
- Expected format and content for job listing data are described, highlighting necessary data fields (e.g., title, company, skills) and their data types.

Example Use Cases:
Example Use Cases
Use Case 1: Scraping Job Listings for Data Scientist Roles in New York
Objective: Collect job listings for the position of Data Scientist located in New York.

Code Snippet:from job_scraper import scrape_jobs

# Define search criteria
criteria = {
    'title': 'Data Scientist',
    'location': 'New York'
}

# Execute scraping function
job_listings = scrape_jobs(criteria)

print(f"Number of jobs found: {len(job_listings)}")

Expected Outcome: This will print the number of Data Scientist positions found in New York. The job_listings variable will contain a list of dictionaries, each representing a job posting with details such as the job title, company, and skills required.

Use Case 2: Analyzing Skill Frequencies from Scraped Job Listings
Objective: After collecting job listings, analyze the data to identify the top skills required for Data Scientist positions.

Code Snippet: from job_scraper import scrape_jobs, analyze_skills

# Assuming job_listings is obtained from the previous use case
# Analyze the skills from the job listings
skills_analysis = analyze_skills(job_listings)

# Print the top 5 skills
top_skills = sorted(skills_analysis.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]
for skill, count in top_skills:
    print(f"{skill}: {count} times mentioned")
    
Expected Outcome: This will display the top 5 skills mentioned in the job listings for Data Scientist positions, along with how many times each skill was mentioned. This information helps job seekers understand which skills are currently in demand.

Use Case 3: Generating a Summary Report on Job Market Trends
Objective: Generate a report summarizing the analysis results, providing insights into the job market for Data Scientist roles.

Code Snippet: from job_scraper import scrape_jobs, analyze_skills, generate_summary_report

# Assuming skills_analysis is obtained from the previous use case
# Generate a summary report
summary_report = generate_summary_report(skills_analysis)

print(summary_report)

Expected Outcome: This code generates a text-based summary report detailing the analysis of job listings, including key trends like the most in-demand skills. The print statement outputs the summary to the console, but this could also be written to a file for permanent storage.

For the project on developing a Python-based weather dashboard:

**Project Description**: This project aims to develop a Python-based weather dashboard that fetches and displays current weather conditions and forecasts from an API. It will feature three main functions: 1) retrieving weather data based on user-inputted city names; 2) displaying current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, and wind; 3) providing a 5-day weather forecast to help users plan ahead. The goal is to offer a user-friendly interface for quick access to weather information, aiding in daily planning and event scheduling. The project will involve coding, API interaction, and creating a graphical user interface.

**Function Descriptions**:

a. **get_current_weather(city)**: Retrieves current weather data for the specified city.  
b. **display_weather(data)**: Displays the current weather conditions on the dashboard.  
c. **get_weather_forecast(city)**: Fetches a 5-day weather forecast for the specified city.  

This description outlines the project's objectives, key functionalities, and its utility in providing immediate and forecasted weather information to users.

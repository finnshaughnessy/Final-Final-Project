# Final-Final-Project
**Project Description**:  
This project aims to develop a Python-based personal budget tracker that allows users to manage their monthly finances efficiently. It will feature three main functions: 1) input of monthly income and expenses in various categories such as rent, groceries, and entertainment; 2) calculation and display of total expenses and remaining balance; 3) provision of visual summaries and budgeting tips based on spending habits. The goal is to provide a simple and intuitive interface that helps users keep track of their spending and make informed financial decisions. The project will involve writing Python code to handle user inputs, perform arithmetic calculations, and possibly integrate simple graphical displays using a library like matplotlib for visual feedback.

**Function Descriptions**:

a. **input_financial_data()**: Allows users to input their monthly income and expenses across various predefined categories. This function will store the data in a suitable data structure for further processing.

b. **calculate_balance()**: Computes the total expenses and subtracts them from the income to determine the remaining balance. This function will help users understand how much money they have left at the end of the month.

c. **display_budget_summary()**: Provides a summary of financial activity, including a breakdown of spending by category and visual graphs of income vs. expenses. This function aims to offer actionable insights into users' spending patterns and suggest areas for cost-saving.
